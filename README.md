# Project Description

## Abstract
Mobile Application that allows to invite friends for training together using video call. The fitness trainer can train a group of people in the real time using a group video call.  The sport videos could be used for personal training.

## Personal motivation
As a student I have started this semester influenced with new conditions of Corona Virus and a Lockdown that we have not experienced before in our life. In a group we have discussed the project we had to choose. Being a sport active person I have found an idea of a social fitness application interesting and I saw how I would use such a product personally. During the first weeks of a lockdown before the semester began I did a sport training with my child at home and I saw the almost same training from my Instagram-friends. I understood that I could use these people for the testing of our product that was crucial for the online semester when we could not go out and meet some people near the gym and ask them to help us to test the product.

## Motivation for development

Many people underestimate the fact that the majority of people move less when locked down or in quarantine. This is reinforced by the closure of sports clubs and gyms. On the other hand, the availability and high consumption of food will lead to increasing overweight in the population and associated diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases.
Many online fitness offers are chargeable or do not motivate people enough to participate regularly. We want to combine personal training depending on the interest (for example videos for parents for training together with a child) and a group training in the real time with a video with friends and/or other people. Thus the feeling of the real gym could be reached at home.

## Functionality
The Applicationw will be used being at house, garden or public park. Users won’t use this App during the real visit to a real sport club or gym. How often App will be used depends on the personal preferences and sport interests. It could be 3 times pro week weight workout or daily small challenges with friends. 

## Our Stakeholders
We try to offer a wide variety of sport activities to active  people of all ages who live at home or in quarantine. 

- Active people who miss the regular training during isolation and closed sport clubs
- Parents with babies and children who regularly have not enough time for visiting a gym 
- Adult active people who used to visit a group training session in the gym and missed socialization and their friends
- Adult people who would like to be active but are not able to follow instructions in boring video
- People who like challenges and want to be challenged 
- Professional fitness trainers who can lead  a group online training

# Requirements
### Non-functional requirements:
- Good visual partition of the screen - e.g. The trainer should be shown in a bigger rectangle then the participants
- The trainer can not ask for money in the private chat for their training. Such an attempt should be reported to the security administrator.
- Efficiency - Software should be capable enough to handle 10 000 users with video streaming without affecting its performance
- No delays - e.g. Friends should be invited immediately into online training after the invitation was sent

### Functional Requirements
- Log in
- Sign up
- Forgot password
- Book a course with/without trainer
- Invite friends to a scheduled training
- Add new friends during a workout session
- Leave workout session at any time
- Share training on TV
- Invite/add friends to friend list
- Edit profile
- Edit personal goals
- Mute camera/mic during workout
- If user allows access to their contact list, they can invite friends from their contact list who did not installed App yet
- Trainers can initiate a new online training and schedule a time for it

# Outlook at what we have done

## Affinity Diagramming

The intersection between group training and individual training was identified as "friends", but is not marked in the picture. This is the result:

## Personas

We have created 4 Personas
### Primary Persona
![Persona 1](/files/SocialFitnessPersona1.png "Persona 1")
![Persona 2](/files/SocialFitnessPersona2.png "Persona 2")

### (optional) Extreme Character

## Szenario
[Scenarios](/files/scenarios.pdf)

## UML Use Cases

*Use Case 1:* Inviting friends to a group training, workout with asynchron video exercises.  
![Use Case 1](/files/UseCase1.png "Use Case 1")

*Use Case 2:* Joining a fixed scheduled workout session with a live trainer with some friends.
![Use Case 2](/files/UseCase2.png "Use Case 2")

*Use Case 3:* Meeting only with friends for workout, one friend is doing the lead of the session.

## Moodboard

## Design Rationales
We decided to use the QOS rational, a structure oriented technique, because it helps to think about design alternatives for our App and is more reflective compared to gIBIS.
